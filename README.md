# API-HW

This project is an API practice, utilizing the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/) to load GIF animations related to each selected movie, and also the [OMDB API](http://omdbapi.com/) to show the ratings of that movie from each of the three different sources if available (Imdb, Rotten Tomato and Meta Critics.)

## Getting Started

There are 6 movies loaded by default and you can add as many movies as you desire by simply providing the name of the movie in the text box and clicking the "Add" button.

As soon as you click on the button related to each movie, a request will be sent to each API and the results will be displayed as soon as available. 

* All of the images are by default loaded as still images and by clicking on each image, you can play the animation. If you wish to stop the animation, just click on the image once again.
